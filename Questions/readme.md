##General Inquiries:
	1. Google Analytics is fairly immune to bots:	
		a) Required to load both javascript and google Analytics (ga.js)
		b) There are growing issues that have bots breaking data trends
		c) Important thing to note if using other analytics tools that conforms less to stronger bot rules. (especially if websites only look at traffic)
		d) Also good to investigate monitoring tools and site performance bots.
	2. Time Decay Attribution Model
		- Measuring first interaction to be a smaller attribution than later on. 
		- Example:
			- 12 months ago you clicked an add, but in the last 3 months, more ads convinced the customer to end up in a full data conversion
