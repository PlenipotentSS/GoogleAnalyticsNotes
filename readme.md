	- Continual improvement (Whole Process)
		- Measure: all data needed to answer business questions
		- Report: Send information for those who can use it like reporting
		- Analyze: Segmentation and hypothesis, and determine expectations (then find out why or why not it didn't meat)
		- Test: Different solutions to the problem
			- takes things out of the decision making process
		- Improve: Learn from your last cycle to make a better next cycle

###Segmentation
    - Aggregated data tells you trends, and more importantly the change of trends
	- Identify similar customers, and understanding those trends
    - Breaking up into segments allows you to understand trend changes, and prioritize in the aggregate
    - Common segments (isolate and analyze):
    	- days of the week and hours of the day
    	- Devices / Operating System
    	- Marketing Channels (email, twitter, search)
    	- Geography
    	- Customer characteristics (repeat or first-time)
	- Segmentation can help you find the underlying causes of changes to your aggregate data.
	- Segmentation allows you to isolate and analyze subsets of your data.
	

###Context
	- Internally vs. Externally
		- External:
			- If booms are from company trends or trends within the industry
		Internally:
			- Finds Histroical data to represent benchmarks
			- Using your site's historical monthly visits data to set a future monthly visits target.
	- Using both to determine areas of goals, and importance of goals under the scope of the industry and company's interests.
	- When plotting and understanding quantitative information, everything breaks down to context to understand the better qualitative values
	






##1.C.

###Macro Conversion (channel 1)
	- transaction
	- Sales Leads:
		- A potential customer fills out and submits a lead form.
	
###Micro Conversion (channel 2)
	- indicator that a user is moving toward a macro conversion
	- Maximize Sales:
		- Ecommerce conversion rate
	
###Attribution is assigning credit to each conversion
	- Last Click Attribution (all the data goes to the last conversion)
		-used for years, because it was best we had)
	- Linear Attribution ??
	    - Assists
	        - Interactions occurred before the actual attributions
	        - which players assist to the end result
	    - Goals
		    -Some score goals
		    -need to know which one is used
	- First Click attribution
		- assigning assisting attributions
		

General idea: better understand the journey and to determine what process is best.

The above question was ambiguous, but more explained it is asking what are the values depending on each of the above attributions.
