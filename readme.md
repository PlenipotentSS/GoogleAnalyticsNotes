##1.A.
	Factors to bring the importance of analytics
		- Internet
		- Mobile
		- Cloud Computing

![](images/digan.png)		

	- Avinash Kaushik's definition
		"Digital analytics is the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data from your business and the competition to drive a continual improvement of the online experience that your customers and potential customers have which translates to your desired outcomes (both online and offline)."

![](images/funnel.png)		

	-Key Elements of Google Analytics:
		- Customers:
			- Long time,we had a marketing funnel 
			(awareness > acquisition > engagement > conversion > retention)
			- The best analysis is through the customer!
			Successful, realistic, holistic information!
		- Qualitative (What)
			- Google analytics can take large amount of data through websites
			- Long time, but now has more value
			- Home appliances, mobile, game, computer, etc.
			- Find behaviors that are unexpected or erroneous
		- Qualitative (Why)
			- Make general assumptions to why behaviors occur
			- Inferences to segmented data values
				- Examine if this is specific and methodological
			- Understanding people's motivations
		- Best of both worlds
			- Qualitative data with Qualitative analysis and response to determine trends and behavior of your customers
		- Measuring outcomes
			- What are the important business outcomes, and what your goals are
			- Good to have a good strategy 
			- 5 business objectives:
				- E-commerce: sell products
				- Lead generation: contact information for sales prospects
				- Content publishing: ads shown to visitors
				- Online info: help customers and respond quickly
		- Behavioral data
			- Macro Conversions
				- Main objective
			- Micro Conversions
				- Smaller steps to the final goal
		

![](images/cycle.png)				

	- Continual improvement (Whole Process)
		- Measure: all data needed to answer business questions
		- Report: Send information for those who can use it like reporting
		- Analyze: Segmentation and hypothesis, and determine expectations (then find out why or why not it didn't meat)
		- Test: Different solutions to the problem
			- takes things out of the decision making process
		- Improve: Learn from your last cycle to make a better next cycle
	    - This flow should have qualitative and quantitative data to help you get to know your customers and their behaviors. 

Know the importance of genre, and how we interact with the customer and what we do with it!

![](images/segmentation.png)

###Segmentation
    - Aggregated data tells you trends, and more importantly the change of trends
	- Identify similar customers, and understanding those trends
    - Breaking up into segments allows you to understand trend changes, and prioritize in the aggregate
    - Common segments (isolate and analyze):
    	- days of the week and hours of the day
    	- Devices / Operating System
    	- Marketing Channels (email, twitter, search)
    	- Geography
    	- Customer characteristics (repeat or first-time)
	- Segmentation can help you find the underlying causes of changes to your aggregate data.
	- Segmentation allows you to isolate and analyze subsets of your data.
	

###Context
	- Internally vs. Externally
		- External:
			- If booms are from company trends or trends within the industry
		Internally:
			- Finds Histroical data to represent benchmarks
			- Using your site's historical monthly visits data to set a future monthly visits target.
	- Using both to determine areas of goals, and importance of goals under the scope of the industry and company's interests.
	- When plotting and understanding quantitative information, everything breaks down to context to understand the better qualitative values
	






##1.C. Conversion & Conversion Attribution

###Macro Conversion (channel 1)
	- Completes an Action as a desired business goal
	- E-Commerce: Transaction
	- Sales Leads:
		- A potential customer fills out and submits a lead form.
	
###Micro Conversion (channel 2)
	- Better understand the journey of your customers
	- Indicator that a user is moving toward a macro conversion
	- Maximize Sales:
		- Ecommerce conversion rate
	
###Attribution is assigning credit to each conversion
	- Assigning Credit for a Conversion
	- Understanding Attribution channels:
	    - Assists
	        - Interactions occurred before the actual attributions
	        - Which players assist to the end result
	    - Goals
		    - Some score goals
		    - Need to know which one is used
	- Channel Grouping Path (inside Google Analytics to understand common attributions)
	- Common attribution mistakes:
		- keywords under research may be misguided when tracking attributions
		- Just because keywords are not highly visible in ads, etc, removing them may be harmful.
		- Case Study:
			- Winery (Winery wedding venues)
				- Customer's search very broad, and then find information down the funnel
				- Then when the submit the form, they just look up the name and go straight to the website
		- Data-Driven doesn't tell the whole picture
			- Need to be mindful of all attributions that may not be physically tracked (like different devices)
				

![](images/last-conversion.png)

	- Last Click Attribution (all the data goes to the last conversion)
		- Oldest Attribution 
		- Using the last step as the major attribution to bring about the macro conversion
		    
![](images/first-conversion.png)		    

	- First Click attribution
		- Determining if a channel is good for initiating sales. One big example is a youtube for sales videos that bring major product sales

![](images/linear-attribution.png)		    		

	- Linear Attribution
		- Assigning assisting attributions
		- This is very commonly explained with ads, social media and other assists that customers see over time to get them to a full macro-conversion
	
		

General idea: better understand the journey and to determine what process is best. More atttributions at: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1665189

The above question was ambiguous, but more explained it is asking what are the values depending on each of the above attributions. 


##1.D. Measurement Plan

### Channel the implementation for your needs
	-Needed: 
		- Time and effort, people, technology
		- People:
		    - Business Objectives/ Strategies
		    - Understand what analytics does
		    - How to implement Analytics
		- What you measure:
			- Define measurement plan
			- Document technical infrastructure (responsive design, mobile, etc)
			- Creating an implementation plan ( defining the code snippets, and tags required)
			- Web developer / mobile developer team to implement these changes
			- Maintain and refine to keep up with industry

![](images/dig.strategies.png)		

	- Measurement Model: (Avinash's model)
		-Start with business objectives!
		- Digital Strategies 
		- 5 Steps of MEasurement plan:
			- Document Business Objectives
			- Identifiy strategies
			- choose KPIs
			- segmentations
			- choose targets

![](images/process.explained.png)				

		- Case Study (outdoor equipment company) :  Blog, personal website, and live store
			- Business objective: Help people enjoy the outdoors through innovative products and cultivate their love of the outdoors
			- See below for full explanation:
		        - The segments you choose can be the same or different for each of the different devices
	            - Involve your IT Team to document technical insfrastructure
		            - Business needs -> Implementation Plan
		    	        - Query STring parameteres
		    	        - String Redirects
		    	        - Flash and Ajax events
		    	        - multiple subdomains
		    	        - Resopsonsive web design
		        - Create your Implementation PLan
			        - Standard dimensions: basic page tag & metrics
			        - Business outcomes -> goals & e-commerce
			        - clean, accurate data -> filters / settings
			        - marketing channels -> campaign tracking & adwords
			        - simplified reporting -> custom reports & dashboards
		        - Robust implementation plan may need to be done in phases!
	        
![](images/analytics.infrastructure.png)

		- Implementation plan:
			- Define Measurement plan (business + tactics, segments, etc)
			- Document Technical (IT Team)
			- Implementation Plan (
			- Implement ( developers )
			- figuring out time constraints and possible phases.
	
###2.A. How Analytics Works

![](images/google.works.png)

##Collection:
	- Javascript code on every page, collects information right away.
		- browser, os, and gestures, as well as what brought them there
	    - Hit interaction is each action
	    - Large amount of data is just acquired from the snippet
	- Case Studies:
	    - Loyalty program for planes:
	    	- Collect data for frequent flyer miles
	    	- Tracking more specific than just GA
	-Mobile:
		- Each operating system is different
		- tracking is based after activies instead of page views
		- Mobile hist from offline devices can be stored and dispatched to Google each time it connects to the internet
		- Knowledgeable developer is required
		Case Studies:
			- Hit on store location
			- Purchase date, etc

###Data Processing:
	- turns your raw data into something more usable
	- categorizes mobile/non mobile/etc
	
###Configuration
	- add filters, etc
	- Choosing different types of data to be pre-sorted
	- Stored into the database after Data/Configuration
	- Setup, then saved, and cannot be changed (??)

### Reporting
	- Uses all of the information stored and bring informative information to the table
	

###Breakdown (Case Study):
	- Website (includes code)
	- Code sends information to GA, where the data then sends through the cogs of GA.
		- Flowing into the processing image
	- Then flows into a database
		- Pre calculated and stored
		- Day Of Week, and then stored into the database with google's database dables
	- Views then populate reports from the database
		- Views can be populated for each property (inside google analytics)
		- Views have different configurations also
			- Content grooping, filters, and e-commerce	
	        - minimum session timeout
	        - change timeout for compaigns, etc.
		- Used to see a specific subset of the data
		- Views can have filters that also re-catagorize data, to make processed data to be the clearest informative reports as possible.
	- Issues:
		- if done wrong, you can create views that don't fill in gaps
		-Case Study (If an entry goes to blog, then www, then back to blog.) 
			- Accurate amount will track the blog visitation will be blog-www
			- However, if just tracking blog it will be the entire visit (because www is lump summed without tracking)
			- If we just see the session of www, then we measure the timestamp			 and it would show 0 or very little visit, even tho it is actually 140 seconds.
		- Data isn't wrong, it's just not accurate nor completely correct.
	- Don't limit your session tracking to just one page, it is only relevant when tracking the session through the entire site. It's all relative, and not absolute on single page visitation).
